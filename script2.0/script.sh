#A decision was made as to work with lists inside the program instead of working with multiple files.
#Parsing json from broker with jq and storing data inside lists allows for easier explanations and access to curl towards the HTML page.

#without being blocked by the mosquitto process. Once we treated the data gathered, it will come back to the subscribe stage/phase.
