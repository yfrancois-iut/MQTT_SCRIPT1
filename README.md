# MQTT_SCRIPT
The following script is made as to complete SAE15. It revolves around gathering data from an MQTT broker and treating it as to display it in an HTML format, on a website. We use Bash as the programming languauge for this project.
The script and files associated to it are located in the "script2.0" directory. The "SAE15" directory is web related.
The "Old_scripts" directory is, as its name implies it, made to store older scripts that were made for the project. I changes trajectories in the middle of it and stopped working with files in order to work with arrays and lists.
