# MQTT_SCRIPT
The following scripts are made as to complete SAE15. The first script is focused on gathering data from the MQTT broker. The second one will be focused on treating the data previously gathered. Lastly, the third script will serve the purpose of publishing the data onto a website.
## MQTT SCRIPT N°1
First script subscribing to a MQTT field, saving the 20 first outputs, then rewriting on top and archiving data.
## MQTT SCRIPT N°2
This script calculates the average, minimum, and maximum of a list of data gathered. It also echos the sum and each value for debug purposes.
## MQTT SCRIPT N°1-2
A hybrid/compilation/improvement of the first two scripts. It was created to reduce the size of the code.
